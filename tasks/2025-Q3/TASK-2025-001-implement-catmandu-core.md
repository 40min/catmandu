## Description
This epic task covers the entire engineering plan to implement the foundational infrastructure for the "Catmandu" modular Telegram bot. The goal is to build a robust core service that polls the Telegram API, runs a FastAPI server for operational endpoints, and supports modular features ("cattackles") through a dynamic discovery system and the MCP communication protocol.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system is fully containerized and can be run locally using Docker Compose.
- A reference "echo" cattackle is functional, demonstrating the end-to-end message flow.
- Administrative API endpoints for health, cattackle listing, and reloading are operational.
- The core system successfully polls Telegram, routes a command to the echo cattackle, and sends the response back to the user.
