## Description
Implement the service to dynamically discover and load cattackle configurations. This service is key to the system's modularity, as it removes the need for manual registration of new cattackles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The service can scan a configured directory for cattackle TOML files.
- Cattackle configurations are parsed and validated against the `ARCH-cattackle-spec`.
- Valid cattackles are loaded into memory and made available through a registry interface.
- The service handles potential errors during discovery and loading gracefully.

## Definition of Done
- The `CattackleRegistry` service is implemented and functional.
- Basic unit tests for the registry service are in place.
- The service is integrated into the main application process.
