## Description
Create the strict data contracts for all system communication using Pydantic models. These models will define the structure of requests and responses between the core service and the cattackle modules, as well as the configuration format.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `models.py` file exists within the `catmandu` source directory.
- The file contains Pydantic models for `CattackleRequest`, `CattackleResponse`, and `CattackleConfig` (for parsing `cattackle.toml`).
