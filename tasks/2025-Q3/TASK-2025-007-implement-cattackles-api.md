## Description
Implement an API endpoint to expose the current state of the Cattackle Registry. This is important for monitoring, debugging, and administration of the bot.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `GET /cattackles` endpoint is added to the FastAPI application.
- The endpoint returns a JSON list of all discovered cattackle configurations from the `CattackleRegistry`.
