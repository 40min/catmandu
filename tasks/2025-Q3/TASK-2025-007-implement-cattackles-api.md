## Description
Implement an API endpoint to expose the current state of the Cattackle Registry. This is important for monitoring, debugging, and administration of the bot.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new GET endpoint `/cattackles` is added to the FastAPI application.
- This endpoint returns a JSON list of all discovered and loaded cattackles.
- Each cattackle in the response includes its ID, name, version, and description.
- The endpoint correctly interacts with the `CattackleRegistry` to fetch the list of cattackles.

## Definition of Done
- The `/cattackles` API endpoint is implemented and functional.
- The endpoint returns the expected data structure.
- Basic tests verify the endpoint's behavior.
