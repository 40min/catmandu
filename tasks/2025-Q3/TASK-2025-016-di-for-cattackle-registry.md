## Description
This task covers the conversion of the `CattackleRegistry` from a global singleton to a dependency managed and injected by FastAPI. This involves removing the global instance, managing its lifecycle via `app.state` and the `lifespan` manager, creating a dependency provider function, and updating the API endpoint to use `Depends`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The global `cattackle_registry` instance is removed from `src/catmandu/core/services/registry.py`.
- The `CattackleRegistry` instance is created on application startup in `main.py` and stored in `app.state`.
- A `get_cattackle_registry` dependency provider function is created in `src/catmandu/api/dependencies.py`.
- The `/cattackles` endpoint in `src/catmandu/api/cattackles.py` receives its `CattackleRegistry` instance via `Depends`.

## Definition of Done
- Code is refactored as per the acceptance criteria.
- The application starts and the `/cattackles` endpoint functions correctly.
- A new unit test is created that uses `app.dependency_overrides` to inject a mock `CattackleRegistry`.
