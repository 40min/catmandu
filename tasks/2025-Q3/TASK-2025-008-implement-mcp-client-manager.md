## Description
Create a dedicated, testable service layer for handling all MCP communication with cattackles. This encapsulates the `mcp-client` library, isolating its complexities from the rest of the core application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A service is created with a `call_cattackle` method that takes a cattackle identifier and a request payload.
- The method successfully executes a remote call to a cattackle process using the `mcp-client` library and returns the response.
